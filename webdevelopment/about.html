        <h1>
            Hello! My name is Jacob Hock.
        </h1>

        <h3>
            I am a student at the University of Missouri, Columbia studying Information Technology. 
            I am passionate about accessibility in IT and attention to detail when working with customers and clients alike. 
            Some of my interests outside of work are reading, cooking, video games, crafts like origami or embroidering, and hiking. 
            I also like having a creative outlet in Blender, creating custom scenes and renders as well as an outlet in game development platforms like Godot. 
            These offer an insight into one of my most important priorities being learning. 
            Even outside of school, you’ll find me learning more about game development, modelling, Arduino projects, or even just strategies for video games. 
            I hope to continue learning much past my end of formal schooling, best achieved by working in my chosen industry of IT.
