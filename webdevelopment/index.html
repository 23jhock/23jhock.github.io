        <h3>
            As a current student in IT, I want to make technology more accessible for all. 
            I am focused and passionate about accessibility in technology, both in traditional and broader access.
            Whether it be screen readers or teaching people how to interact with technology and making tools to ease the daily annoyances, 
            I want to help anyone who can see use from technology. In addition, I am very passionate about learning. 
            I hope to keep learning past my traditional schooling and well into my career. 
            As technology is a very fast moving and constantly evolving topic, persistent evolution alongside it is very important to me. 
        </h3>
